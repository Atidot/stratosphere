  "Name": "CreationPolicy",
  "Documentation": "You associate the CreationPolicy attribute with a resource to prevent its status from reaching create complete until AWS CloudFormation receives a specified number of success signals or the timeout period is exceeded. To signal a resource, you can use the cfn-signal helper script or SignalResource API. AWS CloudFormation publishes valid signals to the stack events so that you track the number of signals sent.\n\nThe creation policy is invoked only when AWS CloudFormation creates the associated resource. Currently, the only AWS CloudFormation resources that support creation policies are AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup, AWS::EC2::Instance, and AWS::CloudFormation::WaitCondition.\n\nThe CreationPolicy attribute is helpful when you want to wait on resource configuration actions before stack creation proceeds. For example, if you install and configure software applications on an Amazon EC2 instance, you might want those applications up and running before proceeding. In such cases, you can add a CreationPolicy attribute to the instance and then send a success signal to the instance after the applications are installed and configured. For a detailed example, see Deploying Applications on Amazon EC2 with AWS CloudFormation.",
